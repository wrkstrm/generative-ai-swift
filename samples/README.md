# Gemini API Swift SDK sample code

This directory contains sample code for key features of the SDK, organised by high level feature.

These samples are embedded in parts of the [documentation](https://ai.google.dev), most notably in
the [API reference](https://ai.google.dev/api).

Each file is structured as a runnable test case, ensuring that samples are executable and
functional. Each test demonstrates a single concept, and contains region tags that are used to
demarcate the test scaffolding from the spotlight code. If you are contributing, code within region
tags should follow sample code best practices - being clear, complete and concise.
